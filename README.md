# RepoGuide
I have a lot of repos, this is an attempt to organize them

## Active Applications

### [runpaint](https://github.com/Thunderducky/runpaint)
Runpaint is hosted at www.paintaday.com, it is meant as a simple paint application, and is still in active development

## Starter Kits
Starter kits are just projects I use to quickly start new projects so I'm not redoing boilerplate over and over again

### [react-express](https://github.com/Thunderducky/react-express)
A basic starter kit with react and express (no db)

### [webpack-express-starter](https://github.com/Thunderducky/webpack-express-starter)
Webpack and express, for when I don't want to use react, but still want to use ES6 modules

## Example Applications

### [simple_paint_web](https://github.com/Thunderducky/simple_paint_web)
A prototype of [runpaint](https://github.com/Thunderducky/runpaint) done without react

### [my_s3](https://github.com/Thunderducky/my_s3)
A simple program that can upload files to an AWS S3 bucket

### [my-blog](https://github.com/Thunderducky/my_s3)
